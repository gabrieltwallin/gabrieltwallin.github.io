I’m an Assistant Professor (*Lecturer* in the UK system) in Statistics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/) at [Lancaster university](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I was advised by Dr [Yunxiao Chen](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/yunxiao-chen) and Professor [Irini Moustaki](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/irini-moustaki). Prior to that, I was a postdoc at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

## My research

My research focuses on developing flexible statistical and machine learning methods to accurately identify latent (unobserved) structures in social, behavioural and health data. I use these methods to study learning acquisition, health inequalities, public opinion, humanitarian decision-making, fairness in educational measurement and interpretability in psychological testing. I often collaborate with domain experts from various fields, including economics, psychology, political science, the educational testing industry and NGOs. 

From a statistical point of view, my research is focused on developing theory, methodology and computational methods for:   
* The structural learning of (multilayer) latent factor models,
* multivariate outlier detection,
* model-based clustering and classification,
* change-point detection for latent factor models,
* statistical inference for regularised latent factor models.

Please see the Research showcase page for some examples of my research.

If you are a student interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:g.wallin@lancaster.ac.uk).
